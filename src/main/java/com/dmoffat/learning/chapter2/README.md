# Chapter 2 - passing code with behaviour parameterisation
Notes from chapter 2.

- Behaviour parameterisation is a software development pattern that lets you handle frequent requirement changes. In a nutshell,
this means making a block of code available without executing it. This block of code can be used later by other parts of your program.
This block can be passed as an argument to another method that will execute it later.
- After writing similar code, try to abstract.
- The strategy design pattern lets you define a family of algorithms, encapsulate them (called a strategy), and select an algorithm
at run-time.
- Behaviour parameterisation is more flexible than value parameterisation.
- **Quote**: "Threads are like a lightweight process, they execute a block of code on their own"
